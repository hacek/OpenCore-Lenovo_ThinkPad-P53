# OpenCore-Lenovo_ThinkPad-P53
Working lenovo thinkpad p53 opencore sonoma configuration

Need to cleanup and manage few things but:

1) Wifi OK
2) Bluetooth OK
3) Touchpad OK (but bottom buttons don't work as expected)
4) Samsung NVME Crashing (Lexar NM620 1TB Works like a charm I have 2 Lexar 1TB and one Samsung 1TB)

....
To be continued :)
