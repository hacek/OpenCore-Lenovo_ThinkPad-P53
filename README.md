# OpenCore Lenovo ThinkPad P53
Working lenovo thinkpad p53 opencore sonoma configuration

machdep.cpu.brand_string: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9850H CPU @ 2.60GHz
64GB RAM

Opencore 0.9.5 (but OC utility shows 0.6.0 version don't know why maybe some files left....)

Need to cleanup and manage few things but:

1) Wifi OK
2) Bluetooth OK
3) Touchpad OK (but bottom buttons don't work as expected)
4) Audio OK
5) Samsung NVME Crashing (Lexar NM620 1TB Works like a charm I have 2 Lexar 1TB and one Samsung 1TB)
6) Added YogaSMC for better FAN support. (we will see if it works) -- Now works 28.10.2023

To be continued :)
